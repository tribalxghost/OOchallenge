// PART TWO
// Create a class for a car.
//  The Car class should inherit from Vehicle 
//  and each car instance should have a property called numWheels 
//  which has a value of 4.

// Part Three
// Create a class for a Motorcycle.
//  This class should inherit from Vehicle
//   and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels 
//   which has a value of 2. 
//   It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”

// Part Four
// Create a class for a Garage.
//  It should have a property called vehicles 
//  which will store an array of vehicles, 
//  and a property called capacity 
//  which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage.
//   When you create a garage, vehicles will always be empty;
//    you only need to provide the capacity.

// A garage should also have an add method, 
// which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles.
//  However, if you try to add something which is not a vehicle,
// the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”.
//  Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.”

            return "Sorry we are full"
        } else {
            this.vehicles.push(newVehicle)
            return "Vehicle Added"
        }
